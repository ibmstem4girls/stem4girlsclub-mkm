# Club Website Coding Activity - Getting Started

Welcome to the IBM STEM4Girls Teen Tech Club - Markham, Ontario, Canada chapter!

## Pre-requisites
A good editor with HTML highlighting can make editing webpages so much easier! We have few recommendations listed here:

1. [The Atom Editor](https://atom.io) is an open source editor freely available on Windows and Mac
1. [Sublime](http://www.sublinetext.com) is another good choice.
1. An [online web editor](https://html-online.com/editor/) is also available if you don't want to install anything. Just remember to save your file locally on your laptop if you do use this.

A browswer is needed to view the webpage you've created.  Options include the following:

1. [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
